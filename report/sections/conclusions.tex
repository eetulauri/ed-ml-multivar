In this study, we set out to investigate applicability of advanced ML models and intuitively relevant multivariable data in forecasting ED occupancy. Our results suggest that in the ED forecasting context: 1) ML outperforms conventional statistical models as has been demonstrated with other datasets; 2) LightGBM outperforms other DL methods which is in line with previous work; 3) extensive multivariable input data does not significantly improve model performance when forecasting unstratified occupancy statistics and 4) clear association with occupancy and any of the used covariates was not observed.

We identify several directions for follow-up studies.  Stratifying the total visit statistics by functional subunits of the ED (walk-in clinic, medical, surgical, etc.) would likely produce different feature importance statistics, potentially improve model performance and certainly be of operational value. We also note that classification methods should be investigated in forecasting binary crowded state. Finally, the performance of the models has to be evaluated in a prospective setting.
